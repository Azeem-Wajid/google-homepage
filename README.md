This project is a faithful recreation of the Google homepage, built entirely from scratch using pure HTML and CSS â€” no frameworks, no shortcuts, just clean code and dedication!

ðŸŒŸ What makes it special?

Every element, from the nav bar to the footer, was carefully crafted to match the look and feel of the original Google homepage.
Thoughtful use of div, nav, main, and footer tags to structure the page semantically and cleanly.
Extensive use of classes for styling consistency and modularity.
Anchor tags (<a>) are used to create functional-looking links (though they point to # in this clone).
Designed with attention to background colors, spacing, alignment, and fonts to closely mirror Googleâ€™s minimalistic style.
Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes (work in progress).
âš¡ Challenges I tackled

Reproducing Googleâ€™s subtle alignments and spacing with just CSS.
Making sure the design stays pixel-perfect across browsers.
Paying attention to accessibility (using semantic tags like main, nav, and footer) and best practices.
